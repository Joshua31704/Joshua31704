       <p style="color: palegoldenrod;font-size: x-large"> Hi! Welcome to my website! You will see work from my Digital Studio Practice class! I am an amateur, so please bear with me.</p>
       <p style="color: palegoldenrod;font-size: x-large"> As someone who loves menswear and has/is currently taking classes in sewing, particularly men's tailoring. 
           A lot of work you might see in this sight will be related to my hobby (hopefully career) in some way. 
           That said, there will be times where I deviate from menswear and try something different. Such practice is seen in many of my other works not restricted to this class.</p>
