        Fashion trends? Silly, whimsical ideas? Lack of care? Whoever
        creates these garments clearly have something in mind.. at least.. at the time. The amount
        of slop that ends up in stores only to show up in thrift stores, or even worse, landsfills,
        is uncountable. These garments.. so sickingly distorted from their traditional form, amount to nothing
        after the passing of trends. Perhaps the biggest offender (even with a lack of distortion)
        is "vintage" graphic t-shirts. Have you ever been to vintage markets? The amount of unsold graphic tees is
        insane because it's become so saturated that no one needs or wants them.</p>
        <h2 style="color: palegoldenrod">so now what..?</h2>
        <p style="color: palegoldenrod"> i literally have no idea. it's just bad. do you know how much slop i see
        from start up instagram brands? overly excessive designs on garments.. the corny "mock-up" reels where people
        "design" garments from a computer but dont actually know if such things would work on a physical garment..
        excessive pockets.. excessive designs.. excessive fabric.. excessive everything. the distortion can only go
        so far. does it seem like i'm hating..?</p>
        <p style="color:yellow;font-size: x-large"> <u>YES I AM HATING.</u></p>
        <p style="color: palegoldenrod"> i dont care. its literally all trends. the amount of stuff i see be infatuated
        for, for like a year, only to die out and never be seen again, is utterly crazy. the carhartt jackets.. the 
        true relgion jeans.. even LABUBUS. like, im not even sure if im talking about menwear anymore
        (at least the traditional, 1940's-60's garments). i am just making a rant on consumerism in general.
        oh, complaining about not having enough clothes..?? look in your closet and see how much stuff is rotting away.
        i've had people become shocked the moment they see my closet because they deem it "scarce." yeah? im just better
        at not WASTING money on horrible, horrible, trendy clothes that clutter and bombard my closet to</p>
