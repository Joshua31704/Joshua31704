    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;color: orange"> What makes.. bad menswear? How does once create such a failed aesthetic?
        While it's fair that one can say, "oh, such silly things are subjective," there are some things
        that are so horrid enough for society to come together and form a general consensus. Such
        observation could be seen as dismissive of the minority who go against the majority. If deeming
        something as an "aesthetic failure" seems crude, then I beg the question - what would you think of
        someone who believed that 9 + 10 truly equaled to 21?

        <h2 style="color: blue;font-size: larger;font-family: Gill Sans;font-style: italic"> What are characteristics of bad menswear..?</h2>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;color: green"> It's important to separate subjective opinions from more broad ideas that make menswear bad.
        For example, garment fits: full cut, straight cut, American/British/Italian suiting, etc. Such things are
        strongly based in preference and shouldn't be seen as a definitive answer to bad menswear
        (though, it can be if the fit is ill enough). Of course,
        this extends to much other factors such as the garment design, patterning, coloring, etc. To demonstrate what
        bad menswear can looklike, refer to the picture below. </p>

        <p style="color:darkgoldenrod;font-family: sans-serif"> Essentially, this looks like a costume. The overly large striped pattern with a silly color palette
        combined with a poor fitting jacket screams October. Of course, if someone liked this outfit, then there's
        nothing inherently wrong with that. However, they would be seen as an outlier in the menswear community
        and would not fare well having a conversation in Pitti Uomo. Whoever decided to <a href="texture.html">
