    <h1 style="color: darkgoldenrod">So, what is good menswear exactly..?</h1>
    <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: larger">Well, like I said, stuff like this is high subjective even if I was brutish about social norms dictating
        what is deemed good or bad. The most I can do to promote the non-failure of my adored aesthetic is..
        to show the non-failures... (at least to me...) duh...</p>

        <h3 style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: xx-large"> <u>My thoughts on the styles:</u></h3>
    <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: x-large"> Naturally, this is my personal preference in style. Even so, I find it appealing to multiple aesthetics in the menswear genre.
        Softer tailoring paired with relaxed garments with a more coherent color scheme that isn't clownish but more natural makes for a successful aesthetic. 
        Such is the way when I try to dress of course and obviously I wouldn't dress the exact way these people do.
        For example, I'm not the biggest fan of the green fatigues that <u>Simon Crompton</u> (the guy in most of the photos) but even then he still dresses excellently and probably better than me.</p>
        <h4 style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: larger"> So.. now what..?</h4>
        <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: x-large"> So.. I mean.. I hope that what I wrote about was satisfactory enough.. 
            I did sort of try to link my love for menswear in this project under the required terms for the paragraph: distortion, memory, and aesthetic failure/non-failure.
        I truly hope you enjoyed reading my silly site and perhaps take away something from this for your own style...</p>
